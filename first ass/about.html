    <h1>ABOUT HTML</h1>
    <p class="p">HTM is a machine learning model proposed by Numenta, inspired by the structure and function of the human neocortex. It
    is used for pattern recognition and anomaly detection in temporal data.HTM aims to mimic the brain's ability to learn and recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as time-series data.
HTM models consist of hierarchical layers of neurons that learn patterns over time and make predictions based on those
patterns.HTM is not a standard term in web development, but it could potentially be a typo or a variant used informally or in
specific contexts.In some cases, people might use "HTM" informally or interchangeably with HTML, though this usage is not standard.
Given the context of your question, if you were referring to HTML and CSS as initially mentioned, the information
provided in the previous response about HTML and CSS fundamentals in web development should be relevant and helpful.</p>
<h1>ABOUT CSS</h1>
<p class="p">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or
XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). Here's a comprehensive overviewCSS is used to define the visual appearance and formatting of HTML elements. It allows web developers to control the
layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of web pages without altering the structure of the HTML.Multiple CSS rules can apply to the same element. The browser applies styles based on a cascade order, which determines
which rule takes precedence.Determines which CSS rule is applied when conflicting rules exist. Specificity is based on the types of
selectors used (e.g., ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors).</p>
